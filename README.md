We are going to create an E-commerce webstore. You're going to be selling books, music albums and movies. Throughout this project you'll be working as a team to build the layout using HTML, design using CSS and logic using JS. Every week you'll have a minimum set of requirements to complete. Each week we'll be building on your previous work, so that by the end of the course you should have a fully functional front-end app.
